<!-- Instructions for adding the click sound -->
<!-- You need to add a "click.ogg" file to this directory -->

How to get a click sound:
1. **Record your own**: Use any audio recording app to record a short click or pop sound
2. **Download free sounds**: Search for "click sound effect" on sites like:
   - freesound.org
   - zapsplat.com
   - Adobe Stock (free sounds)
3. **Convert to OGG format**: Use online converters or software like:
   - Online-convert.com
   - VLC Media Player
   - Audacity

Requirements:
- File name: click.ogg
- Duration: 0.1 - 0.5 seconds (short and snappy)
- Format: OGG Vorbis
- Size: Keep under 100KB for fast loading

Tips:
- A short "pop" or "click" sound works best
- Avoid sounds that are too long or complex
- Test the volume - it should be pleasant, not jarring
- The game will work without sound, but it's more fun with it!

Temporary solution:
If you don't have a sound file yet, the game will still work perfectly. The click sound will just be silent until you add the click.ogg file.
